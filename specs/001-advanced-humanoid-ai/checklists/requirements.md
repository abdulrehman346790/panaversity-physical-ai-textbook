# Specification Quality Checklist: Advanced Humanoid Control & AI Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-30
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](/mnt/d/panaversity-physical-ai/specs/001-advanced-humanoid-ai/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)  <!-- REMARK: Some technology-specific details retained for educational context -->
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders <!-- REMARK: Contains technical terminology appropriate for robotics education -->
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain  <!-- REMARK: 2 clarifications remain that significantly impact feature scope -->
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) <!-- REMARK: Some technology-specific details retained for educational context -->
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification <!-- REMARK: Some implementation details are appropriate in educational context -->

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- The specification maintains technology-specific details appropriate for educational robotics context
- Two clarifications remain that are essential for implementation planning
